# Graphene

- Doesn't have a maintainer
- Lots of boierplate
    - Show slide from ariadne creator where `graphene` re-occurs like 10 times.


# Tartiflette

- Created by a major company (Dailymotion) who pushed Graphene to the limits


# Ariadne

- Created by a startup ([Mirumee](https://mirumee.com/), makers of [Saleor](https://saleor.io/) and [schemattic](https://schemattic.io/)) who pushed Graphene to the limits
- It's not clear how to do field-level or mutation-argument validation. [This post](https://spectrum.chat/ariadne/general/arguments~059184fe-5bc1-478e-8890-2c4f1b86b7ee?m=MTU3Njg2NjkzNDIyMA==) is the closest thing the maintainers have given us.


# GitHub Star Popularity Context

Ariadne is fending off Tartiflette:

But Graphene still commands a huge lead:
